## Resources & Notes 

CSS Selectors:

* [MDN Reference Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors)
* [MDN Guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors#guides): This is in the same page actually but a little bit buried to the end.
* [Codepen](https://codepen.io/pembeci/pen/oNOvyPG) we used in lecture.
* A cute [playground](https://flukeout.github.io/) with puzzles to teach various selectors.
* Another good playground, step by step [visual tutorial](https://selectors.app).

Preparation for next week:

* Complete at least one of the two playgrounds given above.
* [Install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) using the offical installer.
* Create a project directory and add the [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) library by using poetry.
* Read [overview](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html) of Scrapy and run the toy example there.
