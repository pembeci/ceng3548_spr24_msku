# PROJECT

## Description 

As your course project you will scrape web data and then put scraped data into use in some way. Any website which has useful data can be used. Multiple websites can be scraped depending on your goal. Here are some project ideas:

| Category      | Data          | Usage
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------
| Sports  | Data from a league or sports data provider | Generate charts giving insights about player/team performance. 
| Sports  | Data from a league or sports data provider | Build simple machine learning models, clusters.
| E-commerce  | Products, Sellers  | Price history of products. Discount alerts.
| E-commerce  | Products, Sellers  | Price comparison app by scraping from multiple sites.
| E-commerce  | Products, Sellers  | Price comparison app among products within the same category.
| E-commerce  | Products, Sellers  | Similarity search between products or sellers.
| E-commerce  | Product/seller comments  | Grades based on sentiment analysis
| Politics  | Election results  | Show results on a map by different user filters, choices.
| Politics  | Election results  | Analyse results (compare year to year changes).
| Economy   | Currency prices   | Compare prices from multiple sites.
| Economy   | Country data      | Generate charts comparing countries. Some sources: [World factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/), [OECD API](https://data.oecd.org/api/).
| Entertainment   | IMDB etc   | Generate charts based on movie ratings.
| Entertainment   | IMDB etc   | Cluster movies, directors and visualize.
| Entertainment   | IMDB etc   | Sentiment analysis based on comments or similarity search based on textual data.


We'll cover some charting libraries in class so most straighforward option might be scraping some interesting numerical data and then generating charts for them. Depending on your interests and which courses you already took using the data as input for Machine Learning, NLP etc tasks are also encouraged.  

## Dates

## FAQ

- **How many group members are allowed?** 2 or 3 is the default. For 1 or 4 person groups you need to get my permission. 4 person groups need to submit much more extensive projects for fair grading.
- **Can we do such and such project? Will it be enough?** Ask me in class or by e-mail.  
- **For Phase 2 can we use a console/terminal based UI to let users query our data?** Yes.
- **For Phase 2 if want to provide a web page based UI, does the appearance of pages matter?** No. As long as your pages provide the necessary functionality how it looks doesn't matter.
- **Do I need to use Python in my project?** No. You can use any language you want.
- **Can I use a library which was developed specifically to get data from an API?** No. You need to write the code that will interact with the API yourself.
