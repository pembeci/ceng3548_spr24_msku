30 Rails,['30 Rails'],2016,1,8,30,"A pencil and paper game of building railway networks for one or more players.<br/><br/>30 Rails is played on a 6 x 6 grid of squares. First, each player draws mountains, a mine and four stations on their sheet. The game then consists of thirty turns which will fill the remainder of the grid with track. Each turn two dice are rolled. One die will determine which track type is placed, the other gives constraints as to where the track can be placed. The winner is the player who can connect most stations to each other, and to the mine.<br/><br/>The advanced game adds shares. Players are required to buy shares in any particular line in order to score for it, but choosing the right moment to do so gives flexibility to track placement.<br/><br/>Designed for the 2016 One Page PNP Contest<br/><br/>",['2016 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Nominee'],20
