## WEEK 6

### What you missed if you weren't in class:

* Check the commit notes and code comments in the PR. 
* Instead of hardcoding team pages, we started extracting them from the site too.
* We used a new technique to extract team stats by using the json data embedded in the page source.

### Preparation for next week:

* Read [Items](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html) and [Item Pipeline](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html) pages from the Scrapy tutorial

### Other notes:

* [Online json viewer](https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer#) we used in class.
